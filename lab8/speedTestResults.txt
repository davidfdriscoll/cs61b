java and our hashmap have similar performance (within an order
of magnitude) and are both much, much faster than the
simple linked list map.

linked list is the fastest, but not by much.
Linked list looks like the naive approach, but
presumably if collisions in each bucket are kept small
then the simplest approach is fastest.
